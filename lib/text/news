NEW COMMANDS AND NEW MUD BEHAVIOR:
---------------------------------
**  BETA TEST STAGE ON! Lots to be implemented, wait for a better experience.

> 2017 <

MAR 22 **  Book fixed (I hope). Enfold weapons changed name to just Enfold
           and has been improved and Exorcise as well, type @Rhelp enfold@W and
		   @Rhelp exorcise@W for more information. New command created, type
		   @Raffects@W or just @Raff@W to check your active hatsus/spells.

MAR 20 **  Keys gone when use it to lock or unlock and for now on any keys,
           consumable items or used wand/staffs cannot be gained. Remember
		   to toggle autokey off if you don't want to unlock accidentally.

MAR 17 **  NPCs dies instantly when got negative hitpoints. Jajanken fixed.

MAR 16 **  Prompt now shows enemy hitpoints % and normal colors changed from
		   white to green.

MAR 14 **  NPCs now has a global random drop of booster packs containing 3
           random cards, sometimes nothing happens when you open the pack and
		   sometimes you recive only 1 or 2 cards instead of 3, in that cases
		   you will not lose the booster pack and can open it again, that bug
		   will fix itself when item database grow, if you find any other
		   issue please report by bug command. How more powerful is the NPC,
		   more chances you got to receive a booster pack. Enjoy.

MAR 13 **  NPC stop fighting if player got negative health, but you still can
           die if get mortally wonded (-31hp) or by agressive/memory NPCs, in
		   that case I suggest you call for another players to help. Thanks
		   to player Keberus for that excellent idea, it will save players
		   from nonsense deaths.

           aura types for new players, helping them for a better creation.

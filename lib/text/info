@RClasses, skills, and masters:@y

When you enter the game the first time, you are asked to select a class; either
ENHANCER, EMISSOR, CONJURER, TRANSMUTER or MANIPULATOR. Characters belonging to
each of these classes have their own qualities, abilities, and handicaps.
   It is not unusual that people belonging to different classes, by joining
their efforts and combining their skills, find their chances of survival and
progress greatly improved. Indeed, a team consisting of members from all four
classes can be an extremely powerful unit; capable of opening doors without
keys, creating food supplies out of nothing, and destroying an enemy in
several different ways. It is not advisable for a new player to offend the
members of such a group!

In order to learn the tricks of your specific trade, you need to find your
NEN MASTER, which may take a little exploring. However, you can usually find a
nen master in any reasonably populated city. Once you've found it, you need to
look up your nen master and PRACTICE.

@REquipment:@y

It is never wise to travel without the proper equipment. You may purchase this
in the SHOPS found in any larger city, or you may be lucky and find some left
around, dropped by someone who doesn't need it anymore, for one reason or
another.

@RAbout Staying Fit - Eating and Drinking:@y

At one time or another, you'll see the message "You are hungry". This means
that it's time to find something edible before too long. People don't starve
to death in this world, so have no fear. However, when you are hungry, you do
not build up lost energy, so eventually you'll be unable to do anything but sit
around and feel sorry for yourself, until someone comes by. Then, you can only
hope that it's a benevolent person, rather than a greedy thief or a warrior
lusting for blood.

@RHow use cards - Book and Gain:@y

To gain an item or a card you must hold/grab it, but you can't take it directly
from you book/binder slots, in that case you must get cardname in book.
To check what cards you have in your card binders you must call your "book" and
then look in book, with these you can store or use your cards and keep your
hands free to stock more items, avoid steal skills and carry weight items.

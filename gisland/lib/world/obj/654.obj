graffiti wall south~
   This subdivision was built to use with the TBA housing code since the code
needs rooms that have already been created.  It's a very simple plan with 38
houses, meant to simplify the placing of houses.  Feel free to make any changes.
Look map for a better idea of the layout.

   If you want to use this subdivision but need more than 38 houses, First and
Second Streets can be continued to the east by changing the room names and some
of the exit descriptions.  First and Second Avenue would need to be changed to
Third and Fourth Avenue.  
 
   If you need more space, you might want to change #3 and #8 Second Street to
continue the Avenues southward and change #3 and #8 First Street of the new
section to match.  Of course, First and Second Street would become Third and
Fourth Streets.  
 
Sorry for any errors.  Please wash this wall with zedit.

Hugs,
Parnassus for TBAmud

   Hello my dear.

My spirit is fine, I've met so many friends up here.
Please! Do not wish to stay here too soon about what
I said... live with peace and avoid wars, unlike me.

PS: Ask for that old man who clean the chapel do it
more often... has dust everywhere!

Also gives a feeling of weightless, easing a hike.
